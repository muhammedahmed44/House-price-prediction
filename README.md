# 🏡 House Price Prediction

## 📖 Overview
This is a **Machine Learning project** focused on predicting house prices using real-world housing data. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates house prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other property-related attributes.

This project demonstrates the complete **machine learning workflow**, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
